**about myself**
- 👋 hi, I’m @jesteban1972, a backend developer based in Cartagena/Spain. I´m passionated for many things, being IT and technology one of those. I do develop in several programing languages, being C++ my favorite language (yes, I love strictness and I don't fear pointers), and PHP the one I master best. 

- 👀 I’m interested in computer programming using clean and efficient code, easy to use and maintain. Great fan of DDD and best practices, I try to avoid any spaguetti code when developing something new. in JavaScript I like the smell of vanilla flavour rather then '$' methods. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP8 and JavaScript ES6, among others.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my personal development project, still unpublished but -after my own opinion- very innovative. 

- 📫 How to reach me: contact me via email at jesteban1972@me.com.
